# Apache Airflow Overview

Apache Airflow is an open-source workflow management platform designed to automate and orchestrate complex data workflows and ETL processes. Developed by Airbnb, Airflow allows users to define workflows as code, ensuring better version control, scalability, and ease of use.

### Key Features of Apache Airflow:
- **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**: Workflows are represented as DAGs, where each node is a task, and edges define the dependencies between tasks.
- **Scheduler**: The scheduler triggers tasks based on a defined schedule, handling dependencies and ensuring that tasks are executed in the correct order.
- **Extensibility**: Airflow is highly extensible, allowing users to define custom operators and hooks for various external systems.
- **UI**: Airflow comes with a rich user interface for visualizing DAGs, monitoring task execution, and managing workflows.
- **Scalability**: Airflow can be scaled horizontally to handle large workflows and can integrate with other distributed systems.

## How Apache Airflow Facilitates ETL Pipeline Orchestration

Apache Airflow simplifies the orchestration of ETL pipelines by providing a framework where each step of the ETL process can be defined as a task within a DAG. The following aspects highlight how Airflow facilitates ETL orchestration:

1. **Task Scheduling and Dependency Management**: Airflow's scheduler ensures that tasks are executed in the correct order based on dependencies. This is crucial for ETL processes where data extraction, transformation, and loading must happen sequentially or in a specific order.
2. **Retry Mechanism**: Airflow allows configuration for retries in case of task failures, ensuring robustness in the ETL process.
3. **Logging and Monitoring**: Airflow provides detailed logs and a user interface for monitoring task status, execution times, and failures, which helps in troubleshooting and maintaining ETL workflows.
4. **Integrations**: Airflow integrates with a wide range of services and databases through pre-built operators, enabling easy connections to data sources and destinations.
5. **Parallelism and Concurrency**: Airflow supports running tasks in parallel and managing concurrency, which is essential for handling large volumes of data efficiently.
6. **Code as Configuration**: Workflows are defined using Python code, making it easier to version control, test, and collaborate on ETL pipeline definitions.

## Example of an Airflow DAG for the ETL Process

Here is an example of an Airflow DAG that schedules and orchestrates the ETL process for extracting data from Facebook Ads and Google Ads, transforming it, and loading it into an RDS database:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.dummy_operator import DummyOperator
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
from airflow.providers.amazon.aws.transfers.s3_to_rds import S3ToRDSOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define default arguments for the DAG
default_args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'depends_on_past': False,
    'start_date': datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    'email_on_failure': False,
    'email_on_retry': False,
    'retries': 1,
    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),
}

# Define the DAG
dag = DAG(
    'etl_facebook_google_to_rds',
    default_args=default_args,
    description='ETL pipeline from Facebook and Google Ads to RDS',
    schedule_interval=timedelta(days=1),
    catchup=False,
)

# Define Python functions for data extraction and transformation
def extract_facebook_ads(**kwargs):
    # Code to extract data from Facebook Ads API
    pass

def extract_google_ads(**kwargs):
    # Code to extract data from Google Ads API
    pass

def transform_data(**kwargs):
    # Code to transform extracted data
    pass

# Define the tasks
start = DummyOperator(task_id='start', dag=dag)

extract_facebook_task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='extract_facebook_ads',
    python_callable=extract_facebook_ads,
    provide_context=True,
    dag=dag,
)

extract_google_task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='extract_google_ads',
    python_callable=extract_google_ads,
    provide_context=True,
    dag=dag,
)

transform_task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='transform_data',
    python_callable=transform_data,
    provide_context=True,
    dag=dag,
)

load_to_rds_task = S3ToRDSOperator(
    task_id='load_to_rds',
    schema='public',
    table='ads_data',
    s3_bucket='my-s3-bucket',
    s3_key='transformed/ads_data.csv',
    aws_conn_id='aws_default',
    postgres_conn_id='postgres_default',
    dag=dag,
)

end = DummyOperator(task_id='end', dag=dag)

# Set task dependencies
start >> [extract_facebook_task, extract_google_task] >> transform_task >> load_to_rds_task >> end
```

## Explanation of the DAG
*	start: A dummy task that marks the beginning of the workflow.
*	extract_facebook_task: Extracts data from Facebook Ads API.
*	extract_google_task: Extracts data from Google Ads API.
*	transform_task: Transforms the extracted data.
*	load_to_rds_task: Loads the transformed data into an RDS database from an S3 bucket.
*	end: A dummy task that marks the end of the workflow.
