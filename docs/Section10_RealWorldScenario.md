## Steps to Adapt the ETL Pipeline

1. **Impact Analysis:**
    - **Identify Changes:**
        - Review the updated CleverTap API documentation to understand the changes in the API structure, including new endpoints, deprecated endpoints, and changes in data format or authentication mechanisms.
    - **Assess Impact:**
        - Determine how these changes affect the existing ETL pipeline, including data extraction logic, transformation rules, and data storage schemas.

2. **Update API Integration:**
    - **Modify API Calls:**
        - Update the ETL scripts or tools to use the new API endpoints and adapt to changes in request and response formats. Ensure that all necessary authentication mechanisms are correctly implemented.
    - **Handle Deprecations:**
        - Identify any deprecated API calls and replace them with the new equivalents.

3. **Revise Data Extraction Logic:**
    - **Test New API Calls:**
        - Before making changes to the production ETL pipeline, test the new API calls in a development or staging environment to ensure they return the expected data.
    - **Update Data Parsing:**
        - Modify the data parsing logic to handle any changes in the data structure returned by the new API.

4. **Adjust Data Transformations:**
    - **Transformation Rules:**
        - Review and update the transformation rules to accommodate any changes in the data schema or new data fields introduced by the API changes.
    - **Unit Tests:**
        - Write or update unit tests to validate the correctness of data transformations with the new API data.

5. **Schema Updates in Data Storage:**
    - **Database Schema:**
        - If the API changes introduce new data fields or alter existing ones, update the database schema to accommodate these changes. This may involve adding new columns, modifying data types, or creating new tables.
    - **Migration Scripts:**
        - If necessary, write migration scripts to update the existing data to conform to the new schema.

6. **Update Orchestration Logic:**
    - **Airflow DAGs:**
        - If using a tool like Apache Airflow, update the DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) to reflect any changes in the ETL process flow, such as new tasks for handling the updated API data.
    - **Task Dependencies:**
        - Ensure that all task dependencies are correctly defined and that any new tasks are properly integrated into the workflow.

7. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
    - **Monitoring:**
        - Update monitoring configurations to track the performance and success of the new API calls and transformations. This includes setting up alerts for any failures or anomalies detected during the ETL process.
    - **Logs:**
        - Ensure that logs capture detailed information about the new API interactions for easier troubleshooting.

8. **Testing and Validation:**
    - **End-to-End Testing:**
        - Conduct end-to-end testing of the updated ETL pipeline to ensure that data is correctly extracted, transformed, and loaded into the target system.
    - **Performance Testing:**
        - Evaluate the performance of the updated pipeline to ensure it meets the required SLAs (Service Level Agreements).

9. **Deployment:**
    - **Staged Deployment:**
        - Deploy the updated ETL pipeline in stages, starting with a development environment, followed by staging, and finally production. Monitor each stage for issues.
    - **Rollback Plan:**
        - Have a rollback plan in place to revert to the previous version of the pipeline in case of any critical issues during deployment.

10. **Documentation and Training:**
    - **Update Documentation:**
        - Revise the ETL pipeline documentation to reflect the changes made due to the new CleverTap API. This includes updating API integration details, data schemas, and transformation rules.
    - **Team Training:**
        - Conduct training sessions for the team to familiarize them with the changes and the new processes.
